# Info on Docker DNS Resolution:
#
# FROM: https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/container-networking/
#
# By default, a container inherits the DNS settings of the host, as defined in
# the /etc/resolv.conf configuration file. Containers that use the default
# bridge network get a copy of this file, whereas containers that use a custom
# network use Dockerâ€™s embedded DNS server, which forwards external DNS lookups
# to the DNS servers configured on the host.
#
# The embedded Docker DNS server is at: 127.0.0.11:53.  That IP is pingable
# from the Docker daemon host, but port 53 on that IP is NOT open from the
# Docker daemon host.
#
# The /etc/resolv.conf file for containers using Docker's embedded DNS looks
# like:
#
#    nameserver 127.0.0.11
#    options ndots:0
#
